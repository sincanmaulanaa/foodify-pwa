# Foodify - Find Recommended Restaurants 

## Overview

The Foodify Web App is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that was developed as the final project for the Dicoding Academy. The app allows users to easily browse restaurants, find menus, and save their favorite restaurants. The app provides a fast, intuitive, and reliable experience, even when the user is offline or has a slow internet connection. 

Built using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS Preprocessor (SASS), Webpack, and Workbox, the app is designed to work on both desktop and mobile devices. The app features a responsive, mobile-friendly design that adapts to any screen size and resolution. Users can browse menus, view photos of restaurants, and read customer reviews without having to download or install anything.

One of the key features of the app is the PWA functionality which allows users to install the app on their home screen and use it offline, making it easy to access the app in a more seamless way.

The goal of the project was to demonstrate the students' ability to build a fully-featured web application, utilizing modern web technologies and Progressive Web App features. The app was developed to fulfill the final assignment of the Dicoding Academy and serves as a showcase of the students' skills and knowledge.
